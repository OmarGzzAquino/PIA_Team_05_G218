            <h3>What is the function of the Immune System?</h3>
            <p>
                Agree with “health direct”: “the immune system defends the body
                from the infection. It recogieses the baterias, viruses and parasites
                and abnormal cells like “cancer” cells. It creates an immune
                response and helps the body fight the invasion”. It means that,
                this system defend us against disease-causing microorganisms.
                One thing too important is the leukocyte, which is a white
                blood cell, when they detect a foreign substance, they send out
                 signals and launch an immune attack.

        <div>
            <h3>What is the importance of the Immune System?</h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion, this system is very important because it protects
                the body from harmful substances, germs and cells changes that
                could make you ill.

            <h2>Organs of the Immune System and its Function</h2>
            <img src="../images/immune-system.jpg" alt="Immune System">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><i>Skin:</i></strong> It is the largest organ of the
                    immune system and serves as a physical barrier from many
                    disease-causing agents that we come into contact with on
                    a daily basis.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong><i>Bone Marrow:</i></strong> It is a sponge-like tissue
                    found inside the bones. There is where immune cells are producen
                    and also multiply. These cells move to other organs and tissues
                    through the blood.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong><i>Thymus:</i></strong> It is located behind the breastbone
                    above the heart.It is also a gland where some immune cells madure
                    (only in childrens), and then transformed to fatty tissue. Special
                    types of immune system cells called thymus cell lymphocytes (T cells)
                    mature in the thymus. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong><i>Lymphatic System:</i></strong> It is a network of tiny
                    vessels that allow immune cells to travel between tissues and the
                    bloodstream. This system contains lymphocytes (white blood cells).
                    Lymphocytes try to recognise any bacteria, viruses or other foreign
                    substances in the body and fight them. They are carried in a milky
                    fluid called lymph.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong><i>Lymph nodes:</i></strong>Lymph nodes are small structures
                    that work as filters for foreign substances, such as cancer cells
                    and infections. They contain immune cells that can help fight infection
                    by attacking and destroying germs that are carried in through the lymph
                    fluid. Lymph nodes are located in many parts of the body.

                <li>
                    <strong><i>Spleen:</i></strong> It is located in the left upper abdomen.
                    It stores immune cells, it fights invading germs in the blood and it
                    controls the level of blood cells and, finally, it filters the blood and
                    removes any old or damaged red blood cells.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong><i>Mucuos membranes:</i></strong> Like the lining of the inside
                    of your mouth and nose, trap germs and allow your immune cells to catch
                    and attack them.

            <h3>Allergies.</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most common illness are the allergies, allergies
                are the body’s reaction to normally harmless substances. So
                it means, allergies are your body’s reaction to a foreign protein.
                If you have a allergie your immune system overreacts to its
                presence in your body.

            <h3>HIV/AIDS.</h3>
            <p>
                The “human immunodeficiency virus” also called “HIV” is a virus that
                attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more
                vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact
                with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV. HIV can lead to AIDS
                (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) this is when the body’s immune
                system is badly damaged because of the virus. AIDS could be avoid if
                the HIV is treated early.

            <h3>Crohn´s disease.</h3>
            <p>
                Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes
                swelling of the tissues (inflammation) in your digestive tract, which
                can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and
                malnutrition. The exact cause of Crohn disease is unknown. It occurs
                when your body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy
                body tissue (autoimmune disorder).

        <div>
            <h3>Allergies.</h3>
            <p>
                The best way is avoiding these allergens but It is not always possible.
                ver-the-counter and prescription allergy medications are also a solution
                to managing your allergies. Some of them are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fexofenadine</li>
                <li>Loratadine</li>
                <li>Centirizine</li>

            <h3>HIV/AIDS.</h3>
            <p>
                The treatment for HIV is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).
                ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines (called an
                HIV treatment regimen) every day. 
                ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART cannot cure
                HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer,
                healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission.

            <h3>Crohn´s disease.</h3>
            <p>
                Currently the crohn´s disease has no cure but the is a treatment and is the folllowing:
                <br>
                <i>Anti-inflammatory drugs.</i>
                <br>
                Anti-inflammatory drugs are often the first step in the
                treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They include:
                <br>
                Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids such as prednisone and
                budesonide (Entocort EC) can help reduce inflammation in
                your body, but they don't work for everyone with Crohn's disease.
                <br>
                Corticosteroids may be used for short-term (3 to 4 months)
                symptom improvement and to induce remission. Corticosteroids
                may also be used in combination with an immune system suppressor
                to induce the benefit from other medications. They are then
                eventually tapered off.
                <br>
                Oral 5-aminosalicylates. These drugs are generally not
                beneficial in Crohn's disease. They include sulfasalazine
                (Azulfidine), which contains sulfa, and mesalamine (Delzicol, Pentasa,
                others). Oral 5-aminosalicylates were widely used in the past
                but now are generally considered of very limited benefit.

            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                If we apply robotics to medicine by creating robots, then it could help
                with various tasks, such as taking blood pressure, bringing food to
                patients, looking after patients, monitoring them for complications,
                and even cleaning hospital rooms.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Nano-Robot.jpg" alt="Nano Robot">
            <p>
                In this stage the robot reaches the lymph nodes to help the immune
                system fight a disease that is being investigated by doctors to find
                a cure, where the robot will now be controlled via remote control.
